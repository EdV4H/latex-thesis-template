\section{Hello World}
\textbf{Hello World!} Today I am learning \LaTeX.
\LaTeX{} is a great program for writing math. I can write in line math such as $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
I can also give equations their own space:

\begin{equation}
  \gamma^2 + \theta^2 = \omega^2
\end{equation}

If I do not leave any blank lines \LaTeX{} will continue  this text without making it into a new paragraph.  Notice how there was no indentation in the text after equation (1).  
Also notice how even though I hit enter after that sentence and here $\downarrow$
 \LaTeX{} formats the sentence without any break.  Also   look  how      it   doesn't     matter          how    many  spaces     I put     between       my    words.

For a new paragraph I can leave a blank space in my code.
